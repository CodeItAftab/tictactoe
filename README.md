I am excited to present my latest project, a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This classic game allows users to play either against the computer or challenge a friend for some friendly competition.

Key Features:
Play Modes: Enjoy the flexibility of playing against the computer or engaging in a two-player mode with a friend for an interactive experience.

Responsive Design: The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Smart Computer AI: For solo players, the computer AI has been implemented with intelligence to provide a challenging gaming experience. It evaluates the board and makes strategic moves to give you a tough time.

User-friendly Interface: The clean and intuitive user interface makes it easy for players to understand the game mechanics and quickly get started.

Real-time Updates: The game provides real-time updates on the status of the game, highlighting wins, draws, and the current player's turn.

Reset and Replay: After each game, players can easily reset the board and replay with a single click.

How to Play:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Choose the game mode - "Play Against Computer" or "Play with a Friend."
Click on the grid to place your moves and take turns until there is a winner or the game ends in a draw.
Enjoy the excitement of this classic game, test your strategic skills, and challenge your friends to see who emerges victorious!
